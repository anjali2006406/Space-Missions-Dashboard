# Space Mission Dashboard  

This repository showcases a Tableau project that visualizes data from space missions conducted across various launch sites. The dashboard provides insights into critical metrics like temperature, wind speed, humidity, launch vehicles, mission statuses, and the performance of launch sites.

## Features  

The dashboard addresses the following questions:  

1. What are the average temperature details of the launch sites?  
   - Analyzed average temperatures at different launch sites, such as Vandenberg, Kennedy Space Center, and more.  

2. What are the average wind speed details of the launch sites? 
   - Displayed wind speed variations for each launch site to understand their conditions during launches.  

3. What are the average humidity details of the launch sites?  
   - Explored humidity data for each site to evaluate environmental factors affecting launches.  

4. What are the different varieties of launch vehicles used by different companies? 
   - Visualized the range of launch vehicles used by organizations like SpaceX, Boeing, and Arianespace.  

5. What is the mission status of the companies?
   - Analyzed the success and failure rates of missions conducted by various companies.  

6. Track records of the launch sites.
   - Compared the performance of launch sites based on the number of successful and failed missions.
